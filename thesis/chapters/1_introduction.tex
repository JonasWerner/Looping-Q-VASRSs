\jw{Intuitive introduction to the subject matter, no formulas or definitions. \\
	- Start by firstly introducing trace abstraction: explaining safety of programs \\
	- Introduce program loops, mention what problems they cause -> nesting, branching etc
	- then the 3 possible techniques: unwinding, invariant calculation, summarization with focus on summarization\\
	- use simple running example \\
	- Continue to accelerated interpolation, intuitively explain how it works and how it integrates loop summaries -> meta traces \\
	- Say that Ultimate already has a myriad of loop summarization techniques such as FastUPR and Jordan and show their drawbacks, such as Jordan being only to deal with no variable relations and FastUPRs lack of branching support. \\
	- Introduce qvasr as a solution  \\
	IMPORTANT: Only INTUITIVE explanations, no definitions}
