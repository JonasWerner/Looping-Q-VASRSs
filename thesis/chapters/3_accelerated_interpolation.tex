\jw{Accelerated Interpolation as an extension of trace abstraction is introduced $\rightarrow$ Show how to utilize loop summaries within trace abstraction \\
 	- Error traces  $\rightarrow$ loop relations  $\rightarrow$ reflexive transitive closures  $\rightarrow$ meta traces  $\rightarrow$ interpolation on meta traces \\
 	- "We implemented accelerated interpolation in an earlier project using a myriad of loop summarization techniques... " $\rightarrow$ Introduce various loop summarization techniques (FastUPR, Jordan, Werner) NOT in-depth but show their pros and cons  $\rightarrow$ The cons build a bridge to the next chapter \\
 	- running example will be transformed to a meta trace WITHOUT actual loop summarizations on edges}
