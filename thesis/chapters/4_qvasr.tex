\jw{Introduce loop summarization using rational vector addition systems with resets \\
	- What are qvasr? What are qvasr abstractions? what are least upper bounds on abstractions? \\
	- start with qvasr on example that does not need abstraction $\rightarrow$ no relations between variables \\
	- move on to example with relations between variables; show simulation matrix and imaging \\
	- abstractions are an overapproximation \\
	- imprecise because of ignorance of assumptions $\rightarrow$ transfer to next chapter \\
	- usage of running example which is turned to qvasr abstraction \\
