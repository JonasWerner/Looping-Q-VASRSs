\section*{Abstract}
Analyzing program loops is an important part of multiple software engineering tasks, such as bug detection, test case generation, and optimization. Loop analysis is, however, one of the most challenging aspects of program analysis, especially with complex loops that feature multiple paths and nested loops. A widely used loop analysis technique is computing overapproximative loop summaries that represent the relationship between inputs and outputs as a set of constraints. But overapproximation is prone to imprecision. Kincaid and Silverman proposed a novel overapproximation approach, based on rational vector addition systems with resets (Q-VASR), that guarantees a certain degree of precision. In this thesis we adapted the Q-VASR based loop summarization scheme to the trace abstraction method for proving program safety by implementing a summarization library that is used in two techniques: Directly on traces in the accelerated interpolation framework, which uses loop summaries for creating program state assertions that contain every trace through a loop and as a preprocessor that transforms a given program's control-flow graph by replacing loops with the loop summarization such that trace abstraction considers traces that already contain every trace through a loop.
