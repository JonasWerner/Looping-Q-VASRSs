	- Short introduction: what is Ultimate? $\rightarrow$ software verification framework with toolchains, such as trace abstraction \\
	- accelerated interpolation in ultimate $\rightarrow$ How does it work $\rightarrow$ get trace $\rightarrow$ loop detector $\rightarrow$ accelerator $\rightarrow$ meta trace transformer $\rightarrow$  interpolator (maybe as diagram) \\
	- Focus on qvasr $\rightarrow$ how does that library work? $\rightarrow$ same for qvasrs}
