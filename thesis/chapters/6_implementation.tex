Another approach of utilizing \qvasr summarization is, instead of applying it to traces, to change trace abstraction's input control-flow graph, such that computed error traces already contain summaries. Given a program $P$ and its control-flow graph $G_P$, we devise a depth-first search algorithm to find loops. We introduce a marking function $\alpha: Loc \rightarrow \{nv, v\}$, over the control-flow graph's locations, with $nv$ meaning not visited, $v$ meaning visited. We initialize a stack $\Gamma$, an empty set of traces $T$, and start the search with the initial location $\ell_{init}$, adding each transition $\pi_i$, where $src(\pi_i) = \ell_{init}$ to $\Gamma$. The location $\ell_{init}$ is now marked $v$ and we repeat the following loop detection scheme until $\Gamma$ is empty:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Pop new transition $\pi_j$ from $\Gamma$.
	\item Check if $\ell_j = tgt(\pi_j)$ is marked.
	\item If yes, we have found a loop, with $\ell_j$ being the entry point.
		We begin to backtrack by initializing a new stack $\Gamma_j$, pushing every transition $\pi_k$ where $tgt(\pi_k) = src(\pi_j)$ to it and construct the new trace $\tau = \pi_j$ . For finding the loop entry and with that the trace of the loop, we repeat the following steps: While $\Gamma_j$ is not empty, pop new transition $\pi_h$ from $\Gamma_j$ and check if $src(\pi_h) = \ell_j$:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item If that is the case we found a loop cycle and add $\tau$ to $T$. 
			\item If not, we construct new traces for each $\pi_d$, where $tgt(\pi_d) = src(\pi_h)$, by copying $\tau$ and concatenating $\pi_d$ to it and push each $\pi_d$ to $\Gamma_j$
		\end{enumerate}
	\item If no, add transitions $\pi_l$ with $src(\pi_l) = \ell_j$ to $\Gamma$.
\end{enumerate}
After the search, the set of traces $T$ contains all loops in program $P$. As there can be multiple traces from a loop entry location $\ell_i$, we have to construct a disjunction of the transition formulas beginning in $\ell_i$:
Assume we have two traces $\tau_1 = \pi_{11}, \ldots, \pi_{1n}$ and $\tau_2 = \pi_{21}, \ldots \pi_{2m}$ in $T$, where $src(\pi_{11}) = scr(\pi_{21})$, we construct the formula $\tau_1 \lor \tau_2$ to represent the loop.
This disjunction can now be used in the \qvasr summarization scheme, as defined before.  \par
Recall the program $P$ and its control-flow graph $G_P$ as illustrated in \ref{codeWithAss} and \ref{cfg:P:Ass}. Using $G_P$ and the loop detection scheme, we extract the following loop traces for loop entry $\ell_4$: 
\begin{align*}
	\tau_1 &= \st{x<=20}, \st{x<=10}, \st{z:=x;x:=x+y} \\
	\tau_2 &= \st{x<=20}, \st{x>10}, \st{x:=x+2;y:=y-3}
\end{align*}
Using \qvasr summarization, we get the summary $\psi$ shown before in Figure \ref{loopTF}, which we can now use to replace every transition occurring in either $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$. We get transformed control-flow graph $\bar{G}_P$:

	\caption{The transformed control-flow graph $\bar{G}_P$ that is the result of the control-flow graph transformation of $G_P$}
\end{figure}
This transformed control-flow graph can now be put into the trace abstraction scheme, seen in	Figure \ref{traceAbstractionScheme}, and be used to prove safety by proving possible error traces infeasibility.
