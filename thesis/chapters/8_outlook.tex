To compute a loop summary from a \qvasrs, one has to calculate the reachability relation of the automaton. Haase and Halfon \cite{DBLP:conf/rp/HaaseH14} proposed a polytime procedure that computes a series of formulas from computed Parikh images that, as conjunction, form a summary of the system. This procedure can be adapted to work with \qvasrs. \\ \par
