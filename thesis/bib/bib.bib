abstract="We present Counterexample-Guided Accelerated Abstraction Refinement (CEGAAR), a new algorithm for verifying infinite-state transition systems. CEGAAR combines interpolation-based predicate discovery in counterexample-guided predicate abstraction with acceleration technique for computing the transitive closure of loops. CEGAAR applies acceleration to dynamically discovered looping patterns in the unfolding of the transition system, and combines overapproximation with underapproximation. It constructs inductive invariants that rule out an infinite family of spurious counterexamples, alleviating the problem of divergence in predicate abstraction without losing its adaptive nature. We present theoretical and experimental justification for the effectiveness of CEGAAR, showing that inductive interpolants can be computed from classical Craig interpolants and transitive closures of loops. We present an implementation of CEGAAR that verifies integer transition systems. We show that the resulting implementation robustly handles a number of difficult transition systems that cannot be handled using interpolation-based predicate abstraction or acceleration alone.",

Examples are given of such axioms and rules, and a formal proof of a simple theorem is displayed. Finally, it is argued that important advantage, both theoretical and practical, may follow from a pursuance of these topics.},

A central idea enabling our approach is to use interpolants (assertions generated, e.g., by the infeasibility proof for an error trace) in order to automatically construct such an automaton. A data base of interpolant automata has an interesting potential for reuse of theorem proving work (from one program to another).",

This is achieved by allowing the propositional symbols to take arguments that range over elements of the domain of discourse. These are now called predicate symbols and are interpreted as relations on the domain. Elements of the domain of discourse are denoted by terms built up from variables, constants, and functions applied to other terms. First-order logic also expands the lexicon of propositional logic with the quantifiers ``for all'' and ``there exists'' that are interpreted consistently with their natural language meaning.",

A predicate selection method can be said to be complete for a given theory if it is guaranteed to eventually find atomic predicates sufficient to prove a given property, when such exist. Current heuristics are incomplete, and often diverge on simple examples. We present a practical method of predicate selection that is complete in the above sense. The method is based on interpolation and uses a ``split prover'', somewhat in the style of structure-based provers used in artificial intelligence. We show that it allows the verification of a variety of simple programs that cannot be verified by existing software model checkers.",

Our technical contribution is an interpolant-based software model checking method for recursive programs. The method avoids the costly construction of the abstract transformer by constructing a nested word automaton from an inductive sequence of `nested interpolants' (i.e., interpolants for a nested word which represents an infeasible error trace).},
