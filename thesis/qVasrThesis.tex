\chapter{Trace Abstraction with \qvasr}
A loop in a program can potentially introduce infinitely many program traces that the trace abstraction scheme has to prove infeasible. In this chapter we will introduce methods of utilizing \qvasr-based loop summarization to minimize the number of traces created by loops. We present two approaches, firstly an implementation of the \textsl{abstract} step of trace abstraction as seen in Figure \ref{traceAbstractionScheme} utilizing loop summaries directly in traces, secondly a way of transforming a given program's control-flow graph to replace loops entirely by loop summaries.
