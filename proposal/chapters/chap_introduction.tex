Analyzing program loops is an important part of multiple software engineering tasks, such as bug detection, test case generation, and optimization. Loop analysis is, however, one of the most challenging aspects of program analysis, especially with complex loops that feature multiple paths and nested loops. Loop analysis has been called the "Archilles heel" of program verification\cite{DBLP:journals/fmsd/KroeningSTTW13}. \par
There are three prominent techniques of loop analysis: loop unwinding, loop invariant calculation, and loop summarization\cite{DBLP:journals/fmsd/KroeningSTTW13 , DBLP:conf/cav/SilvermanK19, DBLP:journals/tse/XieCZLLL19}. Loop unwinding deals with a loop by unrolling each loop iteration until a certain number. This technique is quite simple but cannot reason about the program behavior beyond the unwinding bound. \\
Loop invariants are properties that hold before and after each loop iteration, modeling its behaviour. The usefulness of loop invariants is however tied to how strong they are, and finding sufficiently strong invariants "is an art"\cite{DBLP:journals/fmsd/KroeningSTTW13}. A software-model checker, for example, may not terminate if given loop invariants are insufficiently general. \par
Loop summarization on the other hand provides a more accurate and complete view of the loop. A loop summary models the relationship between inputs and outputs as a set of constraints that can be used to replace the loop in a program. Loop summaries are not guaranteed to be precise, meaning they can over- or underapproximate the loop's behavior. Counterexamples found using underapproximative loop summaries are guaranteed to be feasible. But due to the underapproximate nature of the summaries they can miss other feasible counterexample as they model only a subset of the actual loop behavior \cite{DBLP:journals/fmsd/KroeningLW15} Overapproximative loop summaries on the other hand form a superset of the actual loop behavior, resulting in possible spurious counterexamples. The quality of overapproximative loop summaries depends on how much the summary overapproximates the actual loop behavior.\\ \par
Silverman and Kincaid\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/SilvermanK19} proposed an overapproximative loop summarization that \textsl{guarantees} a certain degree of approximation precision.\par 

The proposed technique makes use of vector addition systems which are a prominent class of infinite-state transition systems with decidable reachability \cite{DBLP:conf/rp/HaaseH14}. A vector addition system consists of a finite number of integer-typed variables. When a transition is taken, these variables are updated by an addition of a constant. Silverman and Kincaid use a variation of vector addition systems that are based on rational-typed variables instead of integers and extend transitions by employing the notion of resets. When a transition is taken in a rational vector addition systems (\qvasr) a variable is either incremented by a constant, reset to 0, or reset and incremented.
A \qvasr of dimension $d$ is a finite set $V \subseteq \{0, 1\}^d \times \mathbb{Q}^d$ of transformers. Each transformer $(\vec{r}, \vec{a}) \in V$ consists of binary \textsl{reset} vector $\vec{r}$, where 0 indicates a reset, and rational \textsl{addition} vector $\vec{a}$. A \qvasr $V$ defines a transition system $(S_V, \rightarrow_V)$, with state space $S_V \subseteq \Q^d$, which can transition between states $\vec{x} \rightarrow_V \vec{x}'$, if $\vec{x}' = \vec{r} * \vec{x} + \vec{a}$ for some transformer $(\vec{r}, \vec{a}) \in V$, with $*$ being the Hadamard product. \par A \qvasr can be used to represent an overapproximation of a given transition formula. A transition formula $F$ is a first-order formula defined over free variables $\vec{x} = x_1, \ldots, x_n$ and $\vec{x}' = x_1', \ldots, x_n'$ that designate the state before and after a transition, where $n$ is called the dimension of the formula. Figure \ref{code} depicts a program containing a \texttt{while} loop from lines 4 - 12 for which we want to compute a loop summary using \qvasr.
\begin{wrapfigure}{L}{0.4\linewidth}

	\caption{Program $P$ \\ with \texttt{while} loop.}
	\label{code}
\end{wrapfigure}
To accomplish this we need to compute a \qvasr for every path through the loop. In this example there are two paths created by the \texttt{if else} statement.
Beginning with the \texttt{else} branch, we extract the transition formula:
\begin{equation*}
	G= \ (x \leq 20 \land\ x > 10 \land x' = x + 2 \land y' = y - 3)
\end{equation*}
The variable $x$ is not reset but incremented by 2, variable $y$ is not reset and decremented by 3.
We get reset vector $
\vec{r}_G = \  
\begin{bmatrix}
	1 \\
	1 
\end{bmatrix}
$
and addition vector $
\vec{a}_G = \ 
\begin{bmatrix}
	2 \\
	-3 
\end{bmatrix}$ \\
$G$ can therefore be modeled by the \qvasr
$V_G = 
\begin{Bmatrix}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			 1 \\
			 1
		\end{bmatrix},
		\begin{bmatrix}
			2 \\
			-3
		\end{bmatrix}
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{Bmatrix}
$ \par \vspace{2pt}
For the remainder of this proposal we will use the following, more intuitive notation of \qvasr:
\begin{equation*}
V_G = 
\begin{Bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		x \\
		y
	\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow_{V_G}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		x + 2 \\
		y - 3
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{Bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

From the \texttt{if} branch we extract the following transition formula:
\begin{equation*}
	H= \ (x \leq 10 \land x' = x + y\ \land\ y' = y + 1 \land z' = x)
\end{equation*} In contrast to $G$ there are no constant increments to variables $x$ and $z$. They are changed by an arbitrary amount. A \qvasr cannot represent $H$ by a  \qvasr because they are only able to model transitions with constant resets and increments. We can, however, represent an overapproximation of $H$ as a \qvasr. This is done using linear simulations. Given a transition formula $F$ of dimension $n$ and a \qvasr $V$ of dimension $m$, a linear simulation from $F$ to $V$ is a linear transformation matrix: 
$S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	 s_{1 ,1} & \ldots & s_{1, n} \\
	\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
	s_{m ,1} & \ldots & s_{m, n} \\
\end{bmatrix}$ 
such that for all transitions $\vec{x} \rightarrow_F \vec{x}'$ we have $S\cdot\vec{x} \rightarrow_V S\cdot\vec{x}'$. Meaning, every transition $\vec{x} \rightarrow_F \vec{x}'$ can be represented in $V$ by a matrix multiplication of $S$ and $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{x}'$. The tuple $(S, V)$ is called a \qvasr-abstraction. \par For $H$ we need to calculate both the linear transformation matrix $S_H$ and the \qvasr $V_H$. We know that a \qvasr consists of pairs of reset and addition vectors, we use the formula $S \cdot \vec{u} \rightarrow_V S \cdot \vec{u}$ to get a transition in $V_H$ as $S\cdot\vec{x}' = \vec{r}*S\cdot\vec{x} + \vec{a}$. \\ To get variables that are reset, we consider $\vec{r}$ as the zero vector $\vec{0}$, which forms a linear set of equations that model a set of resets:
\begin{equation*}
	Res_H = \left\{ (\s, a) : H \models \s \cdot \p = a \right\}	
\end{equation*}
For the set of additions, we consider $\vec{r}$ as the constant one vector $\vec{1}$ which forms the set of additions as:
\begin{equation*}
	Inc_H = \left\{(\s, a) : H \models \s \cdot \p = \s \cdot \up + a\right\}	
\end{equation*}
We use the updates to variables: $x' = x + y, \ y'= y + 1\ z' = x$ , found in $H$, to solve the equations in the sets for \s, resulting in: 
\vspace*{-0.5em}
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
		\begin{equation*}
			Res_H = \left\{ (\begin{bmatrix} -a & a & a \end{bmatrix}, a) \right\}\
		\end{equation*}
	\end{minipage}
	\begin{minipage}{0.4\linewidth}
		\begin{equation*}
			Inc_H = \left\{ (\begin{bmatrix} 0 & a & 0 \end{bmatrix}, a) \right\}\ 
		\end{equation*}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}
Observe that these form a vector space. Because we want to construct a linear transformation, we need to compute a basis for each space:
\vspace*{-1em}
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
	\begin{equation*}
		Res_H = \{(
		\NiceMatrixOptions{code-for-first-row=\scriptstyle}
			\begin{bNiceMatrix}[first-row=1]
				 x & y & z \\
				 -1 & 1 & 1 
			\end{bNiceMatrix}, 1)\}
	\end{equation*}
	\end{minipage}
	\begin{minipage}{0.4\linewidth}
	\begin{equation*}
	    Inc_H = \{(
	    \NiceMatrixOptions{code-for-first-row=\scriptstyle}
	    	\begin{bNiceMatrix}[first-row=1] 
	    		x & y & z \\
	    		 0 & 1 & 0 
	    	 \end{bNiceMatrix}, 1)\}
	\end{equation*}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}
Each row of the basis corresponds to a variable in the formula such that we can derive relations between variables. From the reset base we can deduce that the sum $-x + y + z$ is reset and incremented by $1$, meaning that after each transition of $H$ we know that $-x + y + z = 1$ holds. From the basis of additions we derive that $y$ is not reset and incremented by $1$. To form the linear transformation matrix $S_H$ we combine these rows to one coherent matrix. We see that the basis of resets and additions contain only one vector each, resulting in only one reset addition pair for $V_H$. As we have seen $-x + y + z$ is reset and $y$ is not. We get reset vector $\vec{r} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ and because $-x + y + z$ is incremented by $1$, same as $y$, we get addition vector $\vec{a} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$. Resulting in the \qvasr-abstraction depicted in figure \ref{vasr  H}.

				V_H = \begin{Bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} - x + y + z \\ y \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow_V \begin{bmatrix}	1 \\ y + 1 \end{bmatrix} \end{Bmatrix}

\vspace*{-2em}For transition formulas with constant increments, such as $G$, an identity matrix $I$ is used as simulation matrix. \par
The effect on variables by the loop in $P$ can be represented by the following conjunction: 
\begin{equation*}
	x \leq 20 \land (H \lor G)
\end{equation*}
With $x \leq 20$ being the loop guard. We have already computed \qvasr-abstractions for $G$ and $H$. These, however, only model the effect on variables in their respective branch of the \texttt{if else} statement. To get the most precise overapproximation of the whole loop's behavior we need the \textsl{best} \qvasr-abstraction $(\tilde{S}, \tilde{V})$ that simulates every branch in the loop.
We impose a partial order $\preceq$ on \qvasr-abstractions $(S_1, V_1)$ and $(S_2, V_2)$, with $(S_1, V_1) \preceq (S_2, V_2)$ if $(S_2, V_2)$ simulates $(S_1, V_1)$. The best abstraction $(\tilde{S}, \tilde{V})$ is the least upper bound with regard to $\preceq$, meaning $(S, V) \preceq (\tilde{S}, \tilde{V})$ for all \qvasr-abstractions $(S, V)$. The abstraction $(\tilde{S}, \tilde{V})$ computed by iteratively \textsl{joining} abstractions. Joining two \qvasr-abstractions results in a single abstraction simulating both. Figure \ref{vasr} shows the best \qvasr-abstraction of the loop in $P$, which is the result of joining $G$'s and $H$'s abstractions. \\
\begin{center}
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\input{fig/matrix_ex_p0.tex}
		\caption{Best \qvasr-abstraction of the loop in $P$.}
		\label{vasr}
	\end{figure}
\end{center}
Using this \qvasr-abstraction we can derive the following transition formula as loop summary:
\begin{align*}
	\exists k_1, k_2.\ &((-x' + y' + z' = 1\ \lor\ -x' + y' + z' = -x + y + z - 5k_2)\ \land\ y' = y + k_1 - 3k_2)\ \\ &\lor\ x' = x\ \land\ y' = y\ \land\ z' = z
\end{align*}
We see in the example that neither the loop guard \texttt{x <= 20} nor the conditions of the \texttt{if else} statement, \texttt{x <= 10} and \texttt{x > 10}, are not considered in the \qvasr-abstraction $(S_P, V_P)$, leading to the inclusion of transitions that would violate these conditions in the actual loop and would therefore not exist. \\
To exclude such transitions, and by that improve precision of the summary, we constrain \qvasr. We only allow transitions that satisfy a set of predicates $P$. Using predicates in $P$ as control states, we can construct a nondeterministic finite automaton that represents all allowed transitions. This automaton is called a \qvasr with states (\qvasrs), where each transition is labeled by a reset, addition vector pair $(\vec{r}, \vec{a})$. The predicates are pairwise unsatisfiable, minimizing the automaton's possible successor state space. A vector $\vec{x}$ can only transition to $\vec{x}'$ if there is an edge $(p, (\vec{r}, \vec{a}), q)$, with $\vec{x}' = \vec{r} * \vec{x} + \vec{a}$ and $p, q \in P$.
Figure \ref{vasrs} shows the \qvasrs of $P$'s loop, it was constructed using $(S_P, V_P)$, seen in Figure \ref{vasr}, and the predicates $x \leq 10$ and $10 < x \land x \leq 20$ as states.

	\input{fig/qvasrs_ex_p0.tex}
	\caption{\\ \qvasrs of the loop of $P$.}
	\label{vasrs}
\end{figure}
 We see that there are no transitions that violate the \texttt{if else} conditions. \par
To compute a loop summary from a \qvasrs, one has to calculate the reachability relation of the automaton. Haase and Halfon \cite{DBLP:conf/rp/HaaseH14} proposed a polytime procedure that computes a series of formulas from computed Parikh images that, as conjunction, form a summary of the system. This procedure can be adapted to work with \qvasrs. \\ \par

\textsc{Ultimate}\cite{Zitat02} is a software analysis framework consisting of multiple plugins and libraries for various software verification tasks. \textsc{Ultimate} already features numerous loop summarization techniques, they, however, have problems with nested loops, loop branching, and approximation precision. Problems that can be potentially solved by the usage of \qvasrs. We plan on implementing a new loop summarization library based on \qvasrs, integrate it into the \texttt{accelerated interpolation} scheme, which computes state assertions for programs utilizing loop summaries, and compare the performance of \qvasrs to other implemented loop summarization techniques. \par
The remainder of this proposal is structured as follows, in section \ref{prob} we formulate our problem statement, followed by an outline of the project's approach in section \ref{app}, and last but not least we present a timetable showing the chronological order of the project in section \ref{sched}.
