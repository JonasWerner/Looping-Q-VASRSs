The goal of this project is to implement a new loop summarization library in the software analysis framework \textsc{Ultimate}\cite{Zitat02} based on the technique detailed by Silverman and Kincaid \cite{DBLP:conf/cav/SilvermanK19}. The library shall be used in the \texttt{accelerated interpolation} method of interpolant computation and shall furthermore be evaluated against other already implemented loop summarization techniques to test the usefulness and efficiency of \qvasr- and \qvasrs-based loop summarization.
