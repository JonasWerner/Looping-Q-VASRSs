\begin{mydef}
A transition system is a pair T = $(S, \rightarrow)$ consisting of a set of states $S$, and a transition relation $\rightarrow \subseteq S \times S$. We define $\rightarrow^*$ as the reflexive transitive closure of $\rightarrow$.

\begin{mydef}
A rational vector addition system with resets (\qvasr) of dimension d is a finite set $V \subseteq \{0, 1\}^d \times \Q^d$, consisting of of tuples $(\vec{r}, \vec{a})$, with binary reset $\vec{r}$ and rational addition vector $\vec{a}$ of dimension d.
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
A \qvasr abstraction is a tuple $A = (S, V)$ consisting of a rational matrix $S \in \Q^{d \times n}$ and a d-dimensional \qvasr $V$. The dimensions $d$ and $n$ are called concrete and abstract dimensions.
\end{mydef}

Given a transition formula $F$ and a \qvasr abstraction $A$, if $F \entails{S} V$ then we say that $A$ is a \qvasr abstraction of $F$.
