The proposed \qvasrs loop summarization library shall be implemented as envisioned in Figure \ref{fig}: The input consists of a transition formula of a loop, that was computed by other tools. This transition formula is firstly used in the \texttt{predicate transformer} to compute a set of predicates $P$ that fulfill the condition of pairwise unsatisfiability. The \texttt{predicate transformer} will be able to employ different techniques of predicate generation making it possible to test the effectiveness and speed of, for example, stronger versus weaker predicates. Following the predicate generation, an empty \qvasr-abstraction set $\mathcal{A}$ is initialized. We need to compute a best \qvasr-abstraction \pqvasr for each pair of predicates $p, q \in P$. For that we construct the formula $\pqformula = p \land F \land q$, which is checked for satisfiability. If a model $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies $\pqformula$, we search for a cube $c$ in the disjunctive normal form of $\pqformula$ that is satisfied by $\mathcal{M}$ and use the \texttt{\qvasr-abstractor} to compute a \qvasr-abstraction $(S_c, V_c)$ for it. Because we want $\pqvasr$ to be the best \qvasr-abstraction for $\pqformula$, we have to make sure $(S_c, V_c) \preceq \pqvasr$ holds. We have to update \pqvasr in a way that it simulates $(S_c, V_c)$. This is done by a \texttt{join} of the two \qvasr-abstractions. A \texttt{join} consists of two operations, firstly, in \texttt{pushout}, we compute a linear simulation from $S_c$ to $\pq{S}$ and update $\pq{S}$ accordingly. Secondly, in the \texttt{image-builder}, we calculate and incorporate the changes to variables done by $V_c$ into $\pq{V}$. After \texttt{pushout} and \texttt{image} we know that \pqvasr simulates $(S_c, V_c)$ and with that $(S_c, V_c) \preceq \pqvasr$ holds. We do not need another \qvasr-abstraction for $c$, so we update $\pqformula$ to exclude the cube from it. If $\pqformula$ is still satisfiable, we begin anew.
If \pqformula is unsatisfiable, then we know that $\pqvasr$ is the least upper bound and with that the best \qvasr-abstraction for \pqformula. We return and add it to $\mathcal{A}$ and start with the next predicate pair. When every predicate pair has a \qvasr-abstraction, we construct a \qvasrs $\mathcal{V}$. In \texttt{reach} we compute the reachability relation of $\mathcal{V}$ which is then used to form a loop summary that is finally returned to \textsc{Ultimate}.

A master's thesis consists of six months of work which translates to 24 work weeks. In the following we will give an outline of the approach of how we plan to implement a \qvasr and \qvasrs loop summarization library in the software-verification framework \textsc{Ultimate}, use the library with \texttt{accelerated interpolation}, evaluate its performance, and writing a thesis, in this given time frame. \\ \par
