The proposed \qvasrs loop summarization library shall be implemented as envisioned in Figure \ref{fig}: The input consists of a loop's transition formula that was computed in advance by other tools. This transition formula is firstly used in the \texttt{predicate transformer} to compute a set of predicates $P$ that fulfill the condition of pairwise unsatisfiability. The \texttt{predicate transformer} will be able to employ different techniques of predicate generation making it possible to test the effectiveness and speed of, for example, strong versus weak predicates. Following the predicate generation, an empty \qvasr-abstraction set $\mathcal{A}$ is initialized. For each pair of predicates $p, q \in P$ we need to compute a \qvasr-abstraction $\pqvasr$. This is done using the formula $\pqformula = p \land F \land q$, which is checked for satisfiability. If a model $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies $\pqformula$, we take cube $c$ from the disjunctive normal form of $\pqformula$ that is satisfied by $\mathcal{M}$ and use the \texttt{\qvasr-abstractor} to compute a \qvasr-abstraction $(S_c, V_c)$ for it. Because we want $\pqvasr$ to be the least upper bound of $\pqformula$, $(S_c, V_c) \preceq \pqvasr$ has to hold. To ensure this, we need to \text{join} the two \qvasr-abstractions $\pqvasr$ and $(S_c, V_c)$. The \texttt{join} consists of two operations, firstly, in \texttt{pushout}, we compute a linear simulation from $S_c$ to $\pq{S}$ and update $\pq{S}$ accordingly. Secondly, in the \texttt{image-builder}, we calculate and incorporate the changes to variables done by $V_c$ into $\pq{V}$. After \texttt{pushout} and \texttt{image} we know that \pqvasr simulates $(S_c, V_c)$ and with that $(S_c, V_c) \preceq \pqvasr$ holds. We do not need another \qvasr-abstraction for $c$, so that we update $\pqformula$ to exclude the cube from it. If $\pqformula$ is still satisfiable, we begin anew.
If \pqformula is unsatisfiable, then $\pqvasr$ is the least upper bound for \pqformula, we return and add it to $\mathcal{A}$. When every predicate pair $p, q \in P$ has a \qvasr-abstraction $\pqvasr \in \mathcal{A}$, construct a \qvasrs $\mathcal{V}$ using the predicates and \qvasr-abstractions in $\mathcal{A}$. In \texttt{reach} we compute the reachability relation of $\mathcal{V}$ which is then used to form a loop summary that is finally returned to \textsc{Ultimate}.

A master's thesis consists of six months of work. In the following we will give an outline of the approach of how we plan to implement a \qvasr and \qvasrs loop acceleration library in the software-verification framework \textsc{Ultimate}, use the library with \texttt{accelerated interpolation}, evaluate its performance, and writing a thesis, in this given time frame. \\ \par
