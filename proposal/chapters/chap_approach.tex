The proposed \qvasrs loop summarization library shall be implemented as envisioned in Figure \ref{fig}: As input it is given a transition formula, computed from a loop by other tools, and hands it over to the predicate transformer. The predicate transformer computes a set of predicates $P$ that fulfill the condition of pairwise unsatisfiability and initializes an empty \qvasr-abstraction set $\mathcal{A}$. The predicate transformer can employ different techniques of predicate generation making it possible to test the effectiveness and speed of, for example, strong versus weak predicates. While there are pairs of predicates $p, q \in P$ that do not have a corresponding \qvasr-abstraction $\pqvasr \in \mathcal{A}$, we construct a new formula $\pqformula = p \land F \land q$ and begin to compute \pqvasr. If a model $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies $\pqformula$, we take cube $c$ from the disjunctive normal form of $\pqformula$ that is satisfied by $\mathcal{M}$ and compute a \qvasr-abstraction $(S_c, V_c)$ for it in the \texttt{\qvasr-abstractor}. Because we want $\pqvasr$ to be the least upper bound of $\pqformula$, $(S_c, V_c) \preceq \pqvasr$ has to hold. This is done by \textsl{joining} $\pqvasr$ and $(S_c, V_c)$. In \texttt{pushout} we compute a linear simulation from $S_c$ to $\pq{S}$ and update $\pq{S}$ accordingly. In the \texttt{image-builder} we calculate and incorporate the changes to variables done by $V_c$ into $\pq{V}$. After \texttt{pushout} and \texttt{image} we know that \pqvasr is a least upper bound for $(S_c, V_c)$. Because we do not need another \qvasr-abstraction for $c$, we update $\pqformula$ to exclude the cube from it. If $\pqformula$ is still satisfiable, we begin anew.
If \pqformula is unsatisfiable, then $\pqvasr$ is a least upper bound for \pqformula, we return and add it to $\mathcal{A}$. When every predicate pair $p, q \in P$ has a \qvasr-abstraction $\pqvasr \in \mathcal{A}$, construct edges and transitions building the \qvasrs $\mathcal{V}$. In \texttt{reach} we compute the reachability relation of $\mathcal{V}$ which is then used to form a loop summary that is finally returned to \textsc{Ultimate}.

A master's thesis consists of six months of work. In the following we will give an outline of the approach of how we plan to implement a \qvasr and \qvasrs loop acceleration library in the software-verification framework \textsc{Ultimate}, use the library with \texttt{accelerated interpolation}, evaluate its performance, and writing a thesis, in this given time frame. \\ \par
